During “Operation Protective Edge” there were, according to UN statistics, 2220 Palestinian deaths, of whom 1492 were civilians including 551 children, while Israel suffered 71 fatalities, of whom 4 were civilians.\n\nIsrael is not the only country whose military has committed such crimes. But it was founded through ethnic cleansing and to this day its legal framework systematically discriminates directly or indirectly against Palestinians. Israel occupies the West Bank, Gaza, and the Golan Heights in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, maintains the Wall in violation of the 4th Geneva Convention, tortures detainees including children and makes daily life unbearable for Palestinians including students and academics. This system – which is rightly called apartheid – survives through financial, economic, diplomatic and military support from other governments, mainly the US but also Britain, where the story began. \n\nFinding out how the [[University of Manchester]] (UoM) may be involved is one small response to that continuing outrage. This project started with a series of Freedom of Information requests by Huda Ammori to the UoM, where she is a student and coordinator of the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign. It took 6 months and intervention by the Information Commissioner before the University answered any questions. At that stage, the aim was to identify formal relationships between the UoM and Israeli universities. The eventual answers included an unspecified research project between the Dept of Physics and Astronomy in Manchester, and the Weizmann Institute. \n\nIn October 2017, a graphene contract was signed between Versarien, an extensive commercial partner of the University of Manchester, and Israel Aerospace Industries, the State corporation deeply involved in the attacks on Gaza. In fact, there are multiple bonds between all of these elements of the story: Graphene, Arms, Israel, and the UoM. But the full saga of the University and its dance partners remains under wraps.”\n\n[http://www.labournet.net/other/1804/entangled.pdf](http://www.labournet.net/other/1804/entangled.pdf)","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T19:26:35.69442563Z","tags":null},"/HMRC":{"title":"HMRC","content":"They run the National Clearance Hub at Ralli Quays offices near Salford's Lowry Hotel and across the River Irwell from the old Granada Television studios.","lastmodified":"2023-02-22T19:26:35.69442563Z","tags":null},"/Hensoldt":{"title":"Hensoldt","content":"Sensor systems for the defence industry\n\nThey bought Kelvin Hughes from ECI.
