“When the Israeli military unveiled its new laser weapon system to the world last week, it did so with a video designed to show off its terrifying precision.

In a computer generated warscape, hostile missiles are launched towards an Israeli battery. The "Iron Dome" defence system springs into action, with its latest addition – a roaming eye-like sphere – firing dazzling white light into the sky.

  

The project was initially awarded £30m to be developed by a consortium of companies including Leonardo, [[QinetiQ]], MBDA, Arke, [[BAE Systems]], Marshall and GKN. Its differentiator is its novel power source, a lightweight flywheel system originally developed by the Williams F1 racing team.”
