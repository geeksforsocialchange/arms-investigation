> From Aerospace, Space, Defence to Security & Transportation, Thales helps its customers to create a safer world by giving them the tools they need	

Another huge arms company, not sure why [[CAAT]] don’t list them. Partnership with [[University of Manchester]].

> “Our maritime business specialises in sonar systems for submarines, surface warships, and aircraft as well as communications masts and systems for submarines. We also have a large team working for our UK transportation business. Thales’s tram management system will enable Greater Manchester’s Metrolink project to take five million car journeys off local roads every year and increase the number of trips passengers made on the network each day from 55,000 to over 90,000.”

They are also sponsoring events with the Co-op & [[GCHQ]] to get children and women into coding.


> “Hack Manchester is a 24-hour coding competition where teams of four people turn up to create a product that meets a brief, and present it, in just a day. A junior version runs over two days and is open to young people up to 18.
> The junior event this week had over 110 entrants take part in hacking challenges. Coop Digital was joined by our fellow junior challenge setters Siemens, Thales UK, Greater Manchester Police, Cancer Research UK, Clockwork, [[GCHQ]] and Web Applications UK.”
> “We were happy to see two of our other entrants win prizes too. Team GCHQ>NSA, who created a game for lonely children to play, won the best school/college team challenge.”
