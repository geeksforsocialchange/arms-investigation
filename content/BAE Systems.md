World's 6th largest arms company, tied to some of the most corrupt deals in history last time I checked with Saudia Arabia etc. Many of these weapons directly go on to be used by ISIS etc - if people were serious about tackling terrorism this is where theyâ€™d start!

  

They have been building stealth UAVs at their base in Warton since 2000. They have cyber operations in Leeds (and maybe Manchester?)

## BAE Systems Applied Intelligence

Historically jobs for this division have been advertised as being in Leeds, at:

Avalon House, Savannah Way  
Leeds Valley Park  
LS10 1AB

https://www.baesystems.com/en/cybersecurity/careers/our-locations/uk-and-europe

Whilst they don't advertise as having a Manchester office, they are advertising for roles in Manchester as well as having a specific category on their job search for "Client Site - Greater Manchester"

The roles are fairly standard DevOps / Cloud roles, but require security clearance. Some details from a recent job advert:
