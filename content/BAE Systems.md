World's 6th largest arms company, tied to some of the most corrupt deals in history last time I checked with Saudia Arabia etc. Many of these weapons directly go on to be used by ISIS etc - if people were serious about tackling terrorism this is where theyâ€™d start!

  

They have been building stealth UAVs at their base in Warton since 2000. They have cyber operations in Leeds (and maybe Manchester?)

  

Exhibiting at [[DSEI]] 2021
