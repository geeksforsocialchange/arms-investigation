“Raytheon is fourth in SIPRI’s list of the top 100 arms companies. Its website describes its Missile Systems business as “the world’s premier missile maker, providing defensive and offensive weapons for air, land, sea and space”. The company has multiple sites across the UK.” ([[CAAT]]).

Looks like they have a big academy in Mcr:

“The Cyber Academy is a retraining programme designed to create a new generation of Cyber Security Technicians, who will develop the necessary skills and knowledge to secure Cyber Security related employment. It has been created in partnership with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority as part of the Fast Track Digital Workforce Fund. The Fast Track Fund is supported by Greater Manchester Combined Authority, in partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Lancashire Digital Skills Partnership to address the digital skills gaps across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. This fund has been designed to help support the local economy by building on the key digital skills requirements employers have identified. It will also create inclusive opportunities for groups of people who don’t currently have access to these digital opportunities including BAME communities, unemployed or underemployed individuals, women and ex-armed forces personnel.”

Raytheon have a Cyber Innovation Centre at Floor 7 & 8 at 5 Exchange Quay, Salford, M5 3EF

Raytheon were also part of Trusted Borders consortium which led the Joint Borders Operations Center - later to become National Border Targeting Centre [[NBTC]].
