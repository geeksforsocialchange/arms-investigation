Materials manufacturer creating drone parts as part of [[University of Manchester]] collaboration. 

> “In October 2017, a graphene contract was signed between Versarien, an extensive commercial partner of the University of Manchester, and Israel Aerospace Industries, the State corporation deeply involved in the attacks on Gaza. In fact, there are multiple bonds between all of these elements of the story: Graphene, Arms, Israel, and the UoM. But the full saga of the University and its dance partners remains under wraps.” (see full link below)
> “We completed the rigorous process required to achieve the award of a £5 million Innovate UK loan and our focus is now very much on the monetisation of the graphene technologies in our portfolio.”
