Under the recently signed £2.3 billion contract between UK [[MoD]] and ARTEC - the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and Rheinmetall consortium - a significant portion of the manufacture of the 500 Boxer Armoured Vehicles for the Army’s Strike Brigades will take place in Stockport at KMW’s UK subsidiary, WFEL, creating a substantial number of jobs for both WFEL, in the Greater Manchester region and its UK-wide supply chain.
