### Automatic face scanning for immigration


> “Artificial intelligence footstep recognition system could be used for airport security. The way you walk and your footsteps could be used as a biometric at airport security instead of fingerprinting and eye-scanning.
> Researchers at The University of Manchester in collaboration with the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain, have developed a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI), biometric verification system that can measure a human’s individual gait or walking pattern. It can successfully verify an individual simply by them walking on a pressure pad in the floor and analysing the footstep 3D and time-based data.”
