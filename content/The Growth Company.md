“Greater Manchester has a very significant e-commerce cluster, with businesses like AO.com, The Hut Group, Fanatics and many others making great strides. Cyber security is no less important. The creation of a strategic hub in Manchester for [[GCHQ]], the government security agency, has drawn global players in the form of [[Raytheon]], [[BAE Systems]] and [[Northrop Grumman]]. It is businesses within these and other technology areas where we are strong, including Fintech, which will greatly benefit from home grown innovation that this programme is generating.”

  

Richard Jeffery, Director of Business Growth at the Growth Company said: “The new generation of innovators are certainly conscious of data and ethics issues, not least because, as a society, there has been a public awakening and we are less digitally innocent than we once were. Entrepreneurs are attuned to where the market is going and how standards are changing. Our event is about helping foster discussion, innovation and understanding and collaboration, all of which can benefit a wide variety of SMEs in our region.”

The digital transformation of manufacturing has the potential to kick start a golden age for women in the industry.

  

The number of girls’ participating in STEM subjects at A-level and degree level has increased by a quarter in the last decade*.

  

This pipeline of engineering talent has found its way into manufacturing, which has seen a slow but steady growth in the number of women in the industry, over the same period.”
