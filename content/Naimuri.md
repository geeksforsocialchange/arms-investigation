It's hoped that Naimuri, which works with UK law enforcement, national security and intelligence bodies from its headquarters in Salford, will deliver revenues of over £9m in the 12 months to July 31.

  

The news was revealed in an announcement to the markets on Tuesday by [[QinetiQ]], a multinational defence technology company headquartered in Hampshire.

  

The statement from [[QinetiQ]], which claims to offer "world-class scientific and technological knowledge" via its team of security and defence contractors, added: "We will invest and build upon Naimuri's strong capabilities in data analytics, data intelligence and agile software development to meet customer needs and drive growth in both the security and defence sectors."

  

Naimuri employs around 70 people with its headquarters and main facility in Manchester. It also has an office in St Helens.
