A digital garden tracking our investigation of arms

A good starting point is where this investigation largely began, the [[DSEI]] exhibitors in 2021. The [[GMCAG]] are also a central hub that's another good starting point

The contents in this space are an on-going investigation into the arms trade, with specific focus on the Greater Manchester region. Many contributors have been involved in the production of this content, not all of whom wanted to be named. The views within this space are not necessarily the views of GFSC; we welcome contributions - most pages have an edit link on them, or you can raise an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geeksforsocialchange/arms-investigation).

If you are already a user of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) then you may like to view the contents of this space there instead (it also makes for a good editor of this content if you want to become a regular contributor)
